Over the course of this past week me and my drone team have been creating devices to stay on task, commands to move the drone, and following git flow to push and pull requests.

<h1>
  What Have I Done
</h1>

* Created a Kanban board
* held stand-up meetings with my teem
* added commands to the drone so it can do some neat things

<h1>
   What is a Kanban Board?
</h1>

### A Kanban board is a devide used to help keep track of tasks during a project. Me and my team created some objectives to complete and over the course of the week we have been crossing them off. 

<h1>
  what are stand-up meetings?
</h1>

### Stand-up meetings are quick meetings that are just used to ask 3 simple questions...

1. what did you do yesterday?
2. what will you do today?
3. is there anything blocking your progress?

### These meetings are supposed to last no longer than five mins.

<h1>
  What Commands Did I Add to the Drone?
</h1>

### I created a simple stair step downward after takimg off. the drone would..

1. take off
2. accend about a foot
3. move forward about a foot
4. decend around a foot
5. and move forward again about a foot

### this simple stair step is a proof of concept for moves we may use in the big time trial.
