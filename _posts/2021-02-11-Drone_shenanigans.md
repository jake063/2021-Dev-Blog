Over the past week, me and my class have been learning how data is sent across the internet through IP addresses and how we can use them to connect and fly a drone.

It’s neat!

# How are things on the interwebs connected?

Things on the internet like websites and servers send data to other servers and things, but how do they do that?
The answer is through IP addresses!

# What is an IP address?
All an IP address is an address that defines where data needs to be sent across the internet.

## An Example of an IP Adress
  
192.168 .32.152

This is how IP addresses are structured, they are four sections called octets separated by a "." and can be from numbers 0 to 255. 

There are also public and private network IP addresses, only public IP's can use the internet.

# How do we fly the dang thing?

First, after today’s attempt, my group was unsuccessful at getting lift-off, we will de-bug next week.

But other groups were able to get the thing in the air, so how did they do it?

We already know what needs to be done for it to work, the drone was just not able to see.
