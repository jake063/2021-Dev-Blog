# How are things on the interwebs connected?

Things on the internet like websites and servers send data to other servers and things, but how do they do that?
The answer is through IP addresses!

# What is an IP address?
All an IP address is is an adress that defines where data needs to be sent across the internet.

<u> Example of an IP Address <u/>
  
192.168 .32.152

This is how IP addresses are structured, they are four sections called octets seperated by a "." and can be from numbers 0 to 255. 

There are also public and privet network IP addresses, only public IP's can use the internet.

# Why This Matters

this post is about drones and flying them accross the whole entire world
