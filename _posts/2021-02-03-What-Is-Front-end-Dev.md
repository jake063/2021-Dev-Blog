Front-end development is the literal front end of what we see on a website, the user interface. The user interface consists of...
* text
* buttons
* visual design (css)
The user uses the user interface to interact with the website.

Types of code used in Front-end Dev...
* HTML- for what to display
* css- for how to display it
* javascript- for how parts of the website interact with each other (buttons, etc..)

### My Experience With Front-end Development

Over the course of the last few weeks I have built a pin board. This board can

* display pictures on the site with tags
* add new pictures with tags
* search for tags

The pin board has all three types of code in front-end development, it uses 

# HTML

The big HTML elements of the site are the header, this 

* Links other files to the index
* Links link to font
* displays what the name of the site is

The next part of the HTML is the body, this is the rest of the index. The body does things like

* Defines things for js to work with
* Puts text on the site for css to work with

# css

css is the style of a site

* where text is
* what color the text and background and everything is
* how big or small anything is
* what font text is

# Javascript

Javascript is the last coding language that Front-end devs use. It does many things such as

1. Defining functions for how things interact
  * buttons, etc...
2. also displays words 
  * for buttons or actions
