Front-end development is the literal front end of what we see on a website, the user interface. The user interface consists of...
* text
* buttons
* visual design (css)
The user uses the user interface to interact with the website.

Types of code used in Front-end Dev...
* HTML- for what to display
* css- for how to display it
* javascript- for how parts of the website interact with each other (buttons, etc..)
